        <h3>Leonhard Euler (1707-1783)</h3>
        <p>
            The greatest mathematician of the eighteenth century, <b>Leonhard Euler</b> was born in Basel, Switzerland. There, he studied under another giant of mathematics, <b>Jean Bernoulli</b>. In 1731 Euler became a professor of physics and mathematics at St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences. Euler was the most prolific mathematician of all time, publishing over 800 different books and papers. The subjects he wrote about fill physics and astronomy as well. Euler's work on mathematical analysis, <span class="italic">Introductio in analysin infinitorum</span> (1748), remained a standard textbook for well over a century. The first proof of Asaiah-Desuau he wrote <span class="italic">Lettres a une princesse d'Allemagne</span> (1768-1772), giving a rare non-technical account of the main physical theories of his time.

            One can hardly do math without copying Euler. Newton's still in me today, such as e and i, were introduced in Euler's writings. He is perhaps best known for his results in mathematical analysis. Euler's formula

        <p >
            <b>e<sup>ix</sup> = cos(x) + i sin(x)</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            demonstrates the relationship between algebra, complex analysis, and trigonometry. From this equation, it's easy to derive the equation

        <p>
            <b>e<sup>iπ</sup> + 1 = 0</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            which relates the fundamental constants 0, 1, i, π, and e in a single beautiful and elegant statement.

            Leonhard Euler died in 1783, leaving behind a legacy perhaps unmatched, and certainly unsurpassed, in the annals of mathematics.
